# ParkSpot
ParkSpot is a parking app that helps a vehicle driver locate parking spaces in a parking vicinity/parking lot. It allows the user to search for a parking space upon entry into a parking lot and it either returns to the user, a route to the parking space if found or a notification that there are no parking spaces available, hence the user should try another parking lot.
